WELCOME to MY PowerBI project 01 "Global-Sales"

Before I start I'd like to tell two things and they are...
1. This Project is purely based on Basic Knowledge of Power BI, How to use it, How to get familiar with it etc...
2. If you plan to go ahead and if you're read to implement find the Resource_file (Excel sheet) in the Repos.

As mentioned above this is my very first Project of Power BI. Basically, it covers all the fundamentals tools, Visual tools, DAX Lang & over all functionality of the software.
In the above Power BI project, I've tried to show a snap shot of "Global Sales reports (Equipments)" of Sales, Deliveries, Avg. Delivery Days etc... by using Graphs, charts and many more Visualization tools.
Did small Data transformation & cleaning in order to get an appropiate Data Model.
Then, worked on Reports & Dashboar (Fav. part)
